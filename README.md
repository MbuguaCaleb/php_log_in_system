```

**Abstracted concepts**

**(a)Session**

```
Log in works by storing the user details in a global variable called as session once a user does login.

A Session is a global variable that has details of the user when they login

For logging in we therefore check if the global variable is available or is it non-available.

mysqli_fetch_assoc ->this function fetches the results and stores them in an associative array.

session_start() -> has to be included at the top of the header files so that you may check for the presence of the session variables
